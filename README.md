# Jetpack Factory Construction Project – Project Management Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of core project management tools—**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, **Network Diagram**, and **Gantt Chart**—to plan and execute the construction of a Jetpack Factory, using the **Hubro Business Simulation**.

## Objectives
- Apply PM tools to a simulated business environment.
- Understand scope, time, cost, and resource constraints.
- Reflect on team and business performance in a project setting.

## Key Components
- **WBS**: Breakdown of tasks and responsibilities to manage scope.
- **Network Diagram**: Visual flow of project tasks, showing dependencies and the critical path.
- **Gantt Chart**: Timeline view for task scheduling and progress monitoring.

## Evaluation
- **Business**: Focused on profits but lacked early infrastructure investment. Later adjustments improved revenue but highlighted the need for sustainable planning.
- **Team**: Diverse skills with initial communication challenges. Improved collaboration led to successful project delivery.

## Lessons Learned
- Clear scope and planning are essential.
- Communication and role clarity drive team success.
- Strategic investment and sustainability are key in business simulations.

## Tools Used
- MS Project
- Hubro Business Simulation
- PMBOK Framework
